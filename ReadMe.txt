This project contains my own solutions to the C++ excercises found here:

https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Exercises/Iterations

The page has its own solutions, a couple for each excercise, but I chose to add this here in case someone felt like they wanted to fiddle around with it or have it as a reference.

The solutions are not perfect, and were solved in regards to how I understood the problem; if you feel that I did not fully solve an excercise, or feel that it could be done in a simpler way (that is not completely heinous to look at), feel free to contribute and you will be credited accordingly.

Note: Each excercise is defined as its own class (with 1 or 2 methods) in the header, and then the function is implemented (and called) in the Main.cpp, where the main() method also lives. 

For the sake of saving time, I 'used' the std namespace, but if you are doing this at your own pace, you should try to explicitly quality the functions (i.e. std::cin instead of cin).
