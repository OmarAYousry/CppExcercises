This project contains my own solutions to the C++ excercises found here:

https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Exercises/Iterations

The page has its own solutions, a couple for each excercise, but I chose to add this here in case someone felt like they wanted to fiddle around with it or have it as a reference.

The solutions are not perfect, and were solved in regards to how I understood the problem; if you feel that I did not fully solve an excercise, or feel that it could be done in a simpler way (that is not completely heinous to look at), feel free to contribute and you will be credited accordingly.
